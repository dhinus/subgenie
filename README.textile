h2. Installation

Run @sh install.sh@

This will just copy the sgn executable to your /usr/local/bin directory.

h2. Usage

cd into a subversion working copy and gently rub the lamp running @sgn@:
the genie will grant you three wishes.

h2. Rationale

This utility covers a single usage pattern, but aims to do it well.

The pattern is:
* You have a svn repo with a trunk and one or more branches
* All new work is committed first to the trunk
* It is regularly merged to the branches (example: production branch)

This utility hopefully makes this much less frustrating allowing you to:
* Commit to trunk
* Check that all is good and/or wait for production clearance
* svn switch to the production branch
* sgn (gently rub the lamp)
* You will be presented with a list of unmerged commits, you can now choose to
merge all of them or just some.
* All will be duly recorded in the standard svn mergeinfo property

h2. Requirements

This has been tested with subversion 1.6 and 1.7.
This should theoretically work with 1.5 as well.
